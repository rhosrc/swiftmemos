## Getting Started

[Click the link](https://swiftmemos1.herokuapp.com/) to get started. You can sign up either as an admin or a standard user. If you sign up as an admin, you will be able to create memos and filter them according to date and title. 

## Future Enhancements

The 2 major features we would like to modify are the user permissions and the filter feature. 

Currently admins have the ability to create, update, or delete memos while standard users do not. Using forms, admins would have the ability to add users to their organization. (We also considered having standard users affiliate themselves with a given organization upon registration.)

Standard users would therefore only be able to view the memos and tags associated with the admin's organization.

Lastly, our filter feature would also allow users to sort their memos according to memo content and tag names.
